# Chatbook is now Botscripten

Please visit [the botscripten github page](https://github.com/aibexhq/botscripten) for the latest version.

With the newest version of Twine, a "Chapbook" story format is coming out. We want to minimize confusion for folks writing bots or Interactive Fiction. To be honest, they just sounded **way too similar** and the confusion wasn't worth the clever name of a "chat book".
